# Airfm

Welcome to Airfm, an Airfoil Data Visualization App! This project is designed to help users visualize UIUC airfoil data in a user-friendly and interactive way. This app provides a convenient way to visualise an airfoil and prepare them to be used as curves in Solidworks and/or other modeling software.

## Features

- **Interactive Plotting**: Visualize airfoil data using interactive plots that allow for zooming, panning, and dynamic updates.
- **Customizable Plot Settings**: Adjust plot settings such as axis labels, tick marks, and plot style to suit your preferences.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive user interface designed for ease of use and navigation.
- **Extensive list of airfoils**: A list of airfoils listed in the UIUC airfoil database, available at [UIUC Database](https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python: 3.5 - 3.11 (Ensure you are using a compatible version)
- Qt: 5.15.11 - 5.15.15 (Required by PySide2)
- PySide2: Compatible with Qt 5.15.11 - 5.15.15
- Qt Charts (included with PySide2)

## Coming Features

- **Airfoil analysis**: Use numerical solvers to perform preliminary analysis on airfoils.
- **Multiple Airfoil Support**: Load data for multiple airfoils and compare their performance side by side.
- **Export Objects to CAD**: Provide support to export wings to CAD software rather than only 2D airfoils.
